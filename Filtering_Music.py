# # Filtering Music
# 
# In this notebook we will design and use filters to extract specific audio information from a piece of music.

# In[1]:


get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import IPython
import scipy.signal as sp
from scipy.io import wavfile


# Let's load a short audio clip (hoping we won't be sued for copyright infringment...)

# In[2]:


SF, s = wavfile.read('sm.wav')
IPython.display.Audio(s, rate=SF)


# Suppose I'm interested in the bass part; I know the bass will have most of its energy in the low frequency range. I could try to filter the audio with a lowpass with cutoff, say, 200Hz and see what comes out of it (you will need headphones to hear properly).
# 
# Remember that the clock of the system is given by the sampling rate of the audio clip, so we will need to normalize the frequencies by $SF/2$ so that the highest frequency corresponds to 1. 
# 
# Let's start with a Butterworth filter:

# In[3]:


fc = 200.0
wc = fc / (SF/2)
b, a = sp.butter(6, wc)


# In[4]:


# we can look at the magnitude response
wb, Hb = sp.freqz(b, a, 1024);
plt.plot(wb[0:200]/np.pi * (SF/2), np.abs(Hb[0:200]));


# In[5]:


# let's filter the signal and hear the result
y = sp.lfilter(b, a, s)
IPython.display.Audio(data = y, rate = SF)


# Well, it's certainly not a perfect source separation but, if you're trying to learn the bass part, this would be a good start. 
# 
# We can try to achieve the same effect using FIR filters, and you'll see it's possible but we will need a lot of taps since the bandwidth is small. We can use the built-in normalization facility of Scipy's `remez()` function:

# In[6]:


# transition band:
tb = 100
# length of the filter
M = 1200
h = sp.remez(M, [0, fc, fc+tb, SF/2], [1, 0], [1, 1], Hz=SF, maxiter=50)

w, H = sp.freqz(h, 1, 1024)
plt.semilogy(w[0:200]/np.pi * (SF/2), np.abs(H[0:200]))
plt.plot(wb[0:200]/np.pi * (SF/2), np.abs(Hb[0:200]), 'green');


# As you can see, the FIR filter will be very expensive! Is it worth it? Well, you can judge for yourself: arguably linear phase preserves the instrumental attack more, but the high frequency rejection is not as good.

# In[7]:


y = sp.lfilter(h, 1, s)
IPython.display.Audio(y, rate=SF)


# Just like we tried to extract the bass, we can try to extract parts of the drum patterd. Usually, we get a good feel for the hi-hat and cymbals by keeping frequencies above 7KHz.
# 
# Let's use an FIR highpass; note that, to design a highpass, we choose a type II filter, so the length will be odd

# In[8]:


fh = 4000; 
M = 1601;
hh = sp.remez(M, [0, fh - tb, fh, SF/2], [0, 1], [10, 1], Hz=SF, maxiter=50)

w, HH = sp.freqz(hh, 1, 1024)
plt.semilogy(w/np.pi * (SF/2), np.abs(HH));


# In[9]:


y = sp.lfilter(hh, [1], s);
IPython.display.Audio(data = y, rate = SF)
