This project shows how to build a classifier to detect Atrial Fibrillation in ECG signals using an LSTM network.
The procedure uses oversampling to avoid the classification bias that occurs when one tries to detect abnormal
conditions in populations composed mainly of healthy patients. Training the LSTM network using raw signal
data results in a poor classification accuracy. Training the network using two Time-Frequency-moment features for
each signal significantly improves the Classification performance and also decreases the training time.
